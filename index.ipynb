    "With that, lets go grab an access token from an API site and make some API calls!\n",
    "Point your browser over to this [yelp page](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app) and start creating an app in order to obtain and api access token:\n",

    "\n",
    "You can either sign in to an existing Yelp account, or create a new one, if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the page you see above, simply fill out some sample information such as \"Flatiron Edu API Example\" for the app name, or whatever floats your boat. Afterwards, you should be presented with an API key that you can use to make requests!\n",

Valid key parameters by which to structure your queries, are described in the API documentation which we'll look at further shortly. A final important note however, is the need to replace spaces with \"+\". This is standard to many requests as URLs cannot contain spaces. (Note that the header itself isn't directly embedded into the url itself and as such, the space between 'Bearer' and YourApiKey is valid.)\n"
